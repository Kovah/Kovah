<h3>Hi!&nbsp;&nbsp;:wave:</h3>

I'm Kevin. Web Engineer and Open Source Creator from Berlin, Germany.

I am working as a DevOps Engineer for Universal Music Germany.

Since starting with web development in 2008, I created a lot of different projects, including a StumbleUpon successor, a bookmark manager, a popular invoicing software, a web archive for video game quotes and many more.

Besides working on websites and web apps, I take photos from time to time. You can find most of my photos on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@kovah).
